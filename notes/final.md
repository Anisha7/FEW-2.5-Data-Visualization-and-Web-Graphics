Use the cereal data to compare cereals. 

Make three graphs each a different type. For example: 

- Bar graph
- Pie Chart
- Scatter Plot
- Area
- Radar

You can make a custom graph that isn't one of these types but something of your own invention if you like.

You can use D3, ChartJS, or make your custom system.
