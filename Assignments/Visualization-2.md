# FEW 2.5 Visualization 2

The goal of this assignment is to make an interactive visualization. This will be a visualization that has options that change the way it is display via user interaction. For example clicking a button to sort on age or fare, or a button to hide and show passengers based on their gender or class. 

## Why know how to do this? 

Interaction is the stock and trade of front end development. You should know how to make user interfaces that display data based in user input. 

## What is this visualization?

This visualization should use the Titanic dataset. You can visualize the data in any way you like. Don't worry about making the data understandable, instead strive to make it intersting to look at. 

You can show anything you want in any way you like from the data. The goal, still, is to make something interating to look at more than to tell a story or make the data understandable. 


- Buttons show and hide elements
	- By gender
	- Siblings
	- Passenger Class
	- Embarkation
- Buttons sort data 
	- By age
	- Fare
	- Embarkation
	- Passenger Class 
- Hide and show elements
	- Show/Hide passengers by gender
	- Show/Hide passengers by survivial
	- Show/Hide passengers by class
	- Show/Hide passengers by embarkation
- Sort passengers 
	- Sort on survival 
	- Sort on gender
	- Sort on fare

- Change a property 

You can also think of your own ideas.

Use buttons, toggle buttons, and/or button groups. 

Add some animation by setting the transition property on elements and changing the their styles. 

Add your visualization to your Github Pages collection of visualizations.

| Code quality | There is code... | Code uses functions and is well organized | Code makes use of functions to minimize reducancy |
| Completiobn  | Seems incomplete, missing features from the description, is not on GitHub pages | Is on Github pages, has all feature from the homework description | Includes new features and expands on the homework description |
