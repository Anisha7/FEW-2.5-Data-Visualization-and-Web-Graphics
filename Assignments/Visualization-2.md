# FEW 2.5 Visualization 2

The goal of this assignment is to make an interactive visualization. This will be a visualization that has options that change the way it is display via user interaction. For example clicking a button to sort on age or fare, or a button to hide and show passengers based on their gender or class. 

## Why know how to do this? 

Interaction is the stock and trade of front end development. You should know how to make user interfaces that display data based in user input. 

## What is this visualization?

This visualization should use the Titanic dataset. You can visualize the data in any way you like. Don't worry about making the data understandable, instead strive to make it intersting to look at. 

You can show anything you want in any way you like from the data. The goal, still, is to make something interating to look at more than to tell a story or make the data understandable.
