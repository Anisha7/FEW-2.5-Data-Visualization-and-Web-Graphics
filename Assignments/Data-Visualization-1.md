# FEW 2.5 Visualization 1

## Visualizing data with HTML, CSS, and JS

Your goal is to create a visualization with HTML, CSS, and Javascript from the Titanic dataset. 

For this assignment, the goal is to make the most interesting visualization that you can. Don't worry about telling a story or making the data understandable. **Instead focus on making visuals that are interesting  and fun to look at.**

Use the size shape and color to make your work interesting. 

You should be writing your own code. Don't import any libraries. We will be talking about using libraries in class later. For this assignment the goal is get an idea of the code that is needed to turn numbers into pictures.
