## Overview

Sometimes data changes moment by moment you can display that! 

<!-- > -->

## Why you should know this?

Experimenting weith real time data is expands your skills into new areas. 

<!-- > -->

## Learning Objectives

- Use canvas to draw data
- Use the audio object
- draw real time data

## Real Time Data

Real time data is data that changes from moment to moment, micro-second to micro-second even! 

This can be stock prices, exchange rates, interstellar noise, tectonic motion, heart rates, and more. For this example you will work with audio data.

## Audio

The Audio Object loads audio data. The Audio object does many things. It can play and modify audio, and generate new audio sources and process audio. 

It can also analyse audio and provide information about the audio source.
