# FEW 2.5 Visualization 4

## Interactive Data

**Due Date:** Wed, February 5

Create an interactive visualization. 

## Challenges 

**Challenge display data**

Use a button to display data. Clicking the button should show or hide one featur. For example gender, or embarked. 

The button should display itself in an active state when it's in effect.

You should at least **three buttons**. Each button should display a different aspect of the data.

**Challenge sort data** Clicking a button should sort or filter the data shown. Only one of these buttons should be active at a time. Clicking any one of these should deactivate the others. 

You can sort on any feature in the dataset gender, embarked, survived etc. 

**Stretch challenge** create some buttons that filter the data displayed. 

### Evaluate your work

Add three more visualizations to your Titanic project. There should be three from the previousd assignment. Add three more that show sorting and filtering of the data. 

Include all of your code in a GitHub Repo.

Create a GitHub Page that displays your work live.

The goal is to turn numbers into shapes and colors.

| Aspect | Does not meet | Meets | Exceeds |
|:------------|:-------------|:------|:--------|
| **Completion** | Did not complete three visualizations (of 6) | Completed 3 visualizations (of 6) | The completed visualization elicited wonder and awe from viewers who can't help but say how beautiful they are |
| **Code Quality** | Your code is sloppy and inconsistent | Your code is well formatted and consistently styled | You have linted your code | 
| **Code Craft** | Your code is not DRY | Your code is DRY you are using functions to do your work | Your code has a plan, you know what it is, and you could use it to take over the world |

### Learing Objectives 

| Aspect | Does not meet | Meets | Exceeds |
|:-------|:--------------|:------|:--------|
| **Sort** | You could not use array.sort() without the docs | You can use array sort without the docs to sort strings and numeric values| You could sort just about anything any time or any place, array.sort() is a tool in your utility belt |
| **filter** | You could not use array.filter() without the docs | You can use Array.filter() without the docs | You can filter anything anytime or any place and frequently sort the wheat from the chaff (figuratively speaking) |
