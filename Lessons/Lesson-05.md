## Why you should know this 

While you will more likely work with abstractions to create user interfaces underneath it all of these interfaces are drawn with pixels. Having an understanding of how to draw directly with pixels on the screen will give you a better understanding of what is happening in the abstractions. 

On top of that learnign canvas will give you an extra tool that will allow you to draw complex shapes and generate images from code which has it's use cases.
